## Attendance Monitoring System using Face Recognition

This project implements an attendance monitoring system utilizing face recognition technology. The core of this project focuses on the data analysis and visualization of an attendance dataset, aiming to extract meaningful insights from student attendance records.

### Project Overview

This project involves the analysis and visualization of a student attendance dataset. While the broader concept includes face recognition for attendance monitoring, this specific repository focuses on the data-driven aspects of understanding attendance patterns and student performance.

### Features

  * **Data Loading and Inspection**: Efficiently loads and displays the structure and content of the attendance dataset.
  * **Data Quality Checks**: Identifies missing values and verifies data types to ensure data integrity for analysis.
  * **Dataset Overview**: Provides a summary of the dataset's size and dimensions.
  * **Attendance Trend Analysis**: Visualizes attendance percentages for each day of the week over time.
  * **Performance Distribution**: Analyzes and visualizes the distribution of student marks (GPA) across different divisions.
  * **Attendance-Performance Correlation**: Explores the relationship between attendance percentage and student marks (GPA) through scatter plots and heatmaps.
  * **Demographic Attendance Insights**: Breaks down attendance distributions by city and gender, further categorized by student divisions, using FacetGrid for detailed insights.
